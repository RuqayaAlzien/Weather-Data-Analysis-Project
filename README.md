# Weather Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of a weather dataset to explore patterns, trends, and insights. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and answering specific questions about the weather data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains weather information, including various meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and more. The data spans a specific period and covers multiple locations.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:
- To explore the dataset and understand its structure and contents.
- To clean the data and handle any missing or inconsistent values.
- To visualize the data to identify patterns and trends.
- To answer specific questions formulated at the beginning of the analysis.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis.
- `src/`: Source code for data processing and visualization.
- `images/`: Visualizations and plots generated during the analysis.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Notebooks

1. **01_data_exploration.ipynb**: Initial data exploration, understanding the structure, and basic statistics.
2. **02_data_cleaning.ipynb**: Data cleaning, handling missing values, and data transformation.
3. **03_data_visualization.ipynb**: Visualization of data using various plots to identify trends and patterns.
4. **04_data_analysis.ipynb**: Answering specific questions based on the data analysis.

## Questions Answered

1. **Find all the unique "Wind speed" values in the data**
2. **Find the number of times when the "weather is excatly Clear"**
3. **Find the numbers if times when the "Wind Speed Was exaclty 4 km/h"**
4. **What is the mean value of each columns against each 'Weather Condition'**
5. **Show all the records where Weather condition is Fog**
6. **Find all instances when : "Weather condion" and " Relative Humidity" is grearter than 50 or 'Visibility' is above 40.**
